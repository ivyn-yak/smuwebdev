prelim notes:

1st scenario: you choose all the bad options -
you become the druggie and end up facing bad consequences
however in the end luckily you meet a friend who helps bring you back out from the darkness into the sunshine, and you become a better person.
(resources are listed at the end as a learning point of the game)

2nd scenario: you choose all the good options -
you are the person helping a friend who is a druggie. you have to choose all the right resources and possibly make difficult (?) decisions, in order to help your friend realise his purpose in life and stop abusing drugs.
(resources are listed at the end as a learning point of the game)

there may be a 2-player mode where your friend can help you as a druggie or the other way around??

there may also be a spin-off personality test based on substance abuse

the resources for substance abuse can be listed in a seperate page so that it can be forever available regardless of playing the game

if have free time, can create a tutorial page for how to play the game.

# **possible game framework**
1. you and your close friends decide to meet up at a karaoke place for karaoke. will you meet up? (Y/N)
2. 
    Y: you arrive at the place. there is someone new in the group, whom all your friends love. His name is Bob...
    N: you chill at home for the day, unaware of what's to come...
## part I
3. 
    Y: after a while of karaoke, Bob pulls out something. Your friends whoop in excitement as they peer into a tote bag...
    N: **skip to <part II>**
4. they're calling you over!! move closer to them? (Y/N)
5. 
    Y: you come near them and they show you the tote bag full of colourful sharpies. all your friends are taking one. Janine pushes to you the last sharpie. "it's your gift!! take it."
    N: they come to you anyways and show you the tote bag full of colourful sharpies. all your friends have taken one. Janine pushes to you the last sharpie. "it's your gift!! take it."
6. Will you take the sharpie? Janine is waiting for you... (Y/N)
7.
    Y: you take the sharpie and stare at it curiously...
    N: you try to refuse but Janine's demeanour changes...she stares at you with slight irritation in her eyes, though her smile stays as she pushes the sharpie into your palms. your heart races. your skin burns.
8. Janine and your other friends sit around you. Janine pulls out the cap out of both of your sharpies, revealing a black metal tip that looks pretty dissimilar from a sharpie...
9. To your surprise, everyone around you puts the sharpie to their mouth. Alarmingly, fumes seem to come out of their mouths after taking away the sharpie. Then, flashbacks on lessons about vapes come to mind. You connect the dots...
10. A hand suddenly wraps around yours, bringing the sharpie in your hands to your mouth... Do you resist? (Y1/N1)
11.
    Y1: you resist... Janine's hand is still around you. "Why? just try it, it's really good. look at everyone else!"
    N1: you stare at Janine. She nods in approval, smile on her face... Maybe everything will just be fine then...
12.
    Y1: All your friends start nodding their heads. Go try it, they say. It's soooo good!! ...they say. It'll benefit your mental health, help you destress... Don't be afraid of a little bit of dangerous! You cross the road everday knowing that you could be hit one day, don't you?
    N1: you put the sharpie to your mouth. breathing in subconsciously, something sweet dances within your mouth... it's actually refreshing, and you open your eyes to sunshine and rainbows...
13.
    Y1: ...Apprehensive, you give it a rethink... After all, they might be mad at you if you miss out, right? 
    N1: you take another whiff... your brain goes into a frenzy as you suddenly crave for the next, just to satisfy this burning curiosity emanating from within you. <insert a like button which you can spam sweet icons like strawberries hearts rainbows and unicorns> <after spamming a while, and option to continue shows up.>
14. 
    Y1: Janine squeezes your wrist again, urging you to take the vape. Take it? (Y2/N2)
        Y2: skip to 11N
        N2: you sit in silence, letting the FOMO sink in...your thoughts overwhelm you as you stare at the rest having fun... maybe you should actually try it... (Y3/N3)
            Y3: skip to 11N
            N3: wow, you're strong. you walk out on your friends and leave this group of people. **skip to <part II>**
    N1: slowly... you fall into a cycle... one that you love...
    from that day onwards, you ride on the high, needing more and more whiffs of that magical substance. the familiar strawberry flavours fill your mouth with ecstacy, drowns your brains in mushy heaven, and you can't help but go back to it... because it's fulfilling; because it's phenomenal; because it's something you can't replicate elsewhere.

## part II
N1=Y (you got addicted)
N = (you didn't attend the karaoke that fateful day. now your bestie got addicted after the KTV day)

1.
